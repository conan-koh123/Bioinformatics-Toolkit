# Bioinformatics-Toolkit
(Still work in progress)

When I was a final year life science undergraduate doing my Final Year Project, I thought that it would be good to have personalized programs that cater to the bioinformatics aspect of my project. As it was my first time dealing with bioinformatics then, I was afraid of making the slighest mistake as everything was done almost in a manual manner, such as designing of primers. With personalized programs, it would not only save a lot of time for my project, but also to minimize human errors. Hence, it sparks me to write programs in this project and share with anyone who are interested to use as well as to improve on these programs. I hope that these programs can save time for everyone in doing their research projects. 

1) "Finding coding sequence.py": A program to find the coding sequence from mRNA of interest based on protein of interest

2) "Finding ORF.py": A program to find all the ORF from the mRNA of interest and its reverse complement
